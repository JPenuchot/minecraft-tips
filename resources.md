# Resources

Laziest ways to gather resources.

### Mob loots

##### Slime balls

Slimes spawn in swamp biomes.

##### Ender pearls

Build a villager farm (see [building](building.md)) and get a cleric.

##### Feathers

Build a chicken farm (see [building](building.md)).

### Minerals

##### Flint

Get a lot of stone shovels first, then put a stack of gravel in your left hand, shovel in your right hand, then press both right and left click. It takes about 5 minutes to process a full stack.

##### Emeralds

Build a villager farm (see [building](building.md)) and a **huge** farm with at least 3 different resources. Farm as much resource as you can, then just trade your wheat/carrots/potatoes to a villager (be careful, always trade **one** resource at a time until the villager is fed up so you always have one resource to trade and make him happy again).
